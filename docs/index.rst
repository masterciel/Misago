Users
=====

This part of documentation is aimed at users who interact with Misago by the graphical UI available through internet browser. It's divided in three parts, with first one aimed for guests and signed in members posting on your forums, second one at moderators tasked by maintaining friendly atmosphere and finally third one for those who want to improve their knowledge and understanding of administration tools available in Admin Control Panel.

Developers
==========

Misago is being developed with customizability and extensibility on mind and offers many features for those looking into modifying its look and feel, extending its featurebase or changing behaviour of core features.

And if this isn't enough for you, Misago itself stands on shoulders of `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, powerful and battle-tested web framework with great documentation and rich ecosystem of additional modules (named "apps"). This means Misago is not "just forum solution". Its also complete framework you may use to build your entire site around, writing your own Django apps or installing and adapting one of thousands ready apps freely available in the internet.
