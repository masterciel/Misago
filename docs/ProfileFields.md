Profile fields
==============

Misago allows your users to fill in additional details about themselves for other users to see on their profiles, such as their real name, gender, short bio or contact options such as homepage address or Twitter/Skype handles.

In addition to those, Misago also uses "read only" profile fields to displays users IP addresses on their profiles for forum moderators.
